Node Command Line Utility for Mail Merging
==========================================

This was implemented strictly as a means to challenge myself. I do not recommend it's use for any application other than learning from, critiquing, or using it to get the files necessary in order to complete the challenge yourself.

The first implementation I did is parse.js. I felt it was spaggheti-code and that I could do better, so I implemented mail-merge.js from scratch.

In order to see the utility run:
* Pull the repository
* cd into the directory
* rm output/*
* ./run
* Inspect input/# with output/# based on the file template
